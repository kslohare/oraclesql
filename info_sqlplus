# Oracle offers several different methods for lookup up databases when you're trying to connect to them:
1)tnsnames.ora entries
2) LDAP
3) EZConnect
The most common approach is to put the databases you're connecting to into your tnsnames.ora; usually, your client installation contains an example tnsnames.ora file that you can modify.
The easiest approach is probably to use EZConnect. An EZConnect string is built like
<username>/<password>@<hostname>:<port>/SID
so in your case, it (probably) will be something like
sqlplus scott/tiger@localhost:1521/wborcle
